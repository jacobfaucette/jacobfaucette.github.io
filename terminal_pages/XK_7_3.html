            The 4 great beasts
            XK-7-3 is a defense initiative encompassing the creation of mechanical protectors with the express purpose of safeguarding our borders from outside invasion. The beasts protect our Land, Sea, and Sky with an unyielding vigilance. The Great Worm protects the land, The Great Leviathan protects the seas, and The Great Dragon protects the Sky. Every beast has cutting edge medical capacities for keeping soldiers stable till they are <a href="bible_passages\\Daniel_7_3.html">resurrected</a>, and large internal storage functionality for bringing supplies to facilities in remote locations.
