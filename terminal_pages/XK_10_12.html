        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-10-12 is a heavily augemented illithid with the ability to force necrotized flesh to be <a href="bible_passages\\Exodus_10_12.html">resurrected</a> to a mobile state. The goal of the project was to reanimate soldiers who fall in battle so they can continue to serve their duty beyond death. XK-10-12's abilities have been shown to rival Grand Mages of the Eighth Circle and potentially those in the Ninth.

        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            The project has been deemed a Failure and put into haitus by Dr. Chaymond due to a combination of unwillingness to work with the Empire's goals and an inability to keep the forms of reanimated subjects in a stable state.
