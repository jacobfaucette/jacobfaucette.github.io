        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-6-27 is the fusion and binding of a soul of an Angel with a Warforged shell. This process allows for a greater level of adapability from the Warforged as the bound soul and the underlying programming allow for continous artifical neural network enhancements to be integrated seamlessly. The Angel soul trends towards improving peaceful combat resolution capabilities, but other improvements have been documented.

        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            The budget of XK-6-27 has been migrated to XK-6-66 due the Empire not seeing much potential from the units in combat scenarios
