        <li>These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.</li>
        <li>Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.</li>
        <li>Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.</li>
        <li>Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.</li>
        <li>The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.</li>
        <li>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</li>
        <li>These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.</li>
        <li>I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name.</li>
        <li>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liarsâ€”I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</li>
        <li>Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.</li>
