        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-1-13 is the process of raising the limitiations of mortals by ingniting a subjects Soul Core with a controlled burn. The lost future potential is supplimented by a Resonance-Accumulator of Primal grade. The most common mutations that manifest include:
            <li>Increased Muscle Mass</li>
            <li>Hyper-Regeneration</li>
            <li>Increase Psychic Resonance</li>
            <li>Aura Manipulation</li>

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            The project has been terminated due to a incompatibility issue of the Hyper-Regeneration and test subjects memory functions. When a subject takes sufficient enough damage to trigger the regeneration, body mass is consumed to replace lost cells. Unfortunatly, engram neurons also get consumed, which leads to short term and long term memory problems. Reports also show that amenestics of Class-C or lower are automiatically purged within the subject.
