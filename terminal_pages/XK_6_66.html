        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-6-66 is the fusion and binding of a soul of a Devil with a Warforged shell. This process allows for a greater level of adapability from the Warforged as the bound soul and the underlying programming allow for continous artifical neural network enhancements to be integrated seamlessly. The Devil soul trends towards improving combat and tactical capabilities, but other improvements have been documented.

        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            Current prototypes have an issue of individuality manifesting from the Devil's natural tendencies to find loopholes in contracts.
            <br>A message from the General reads as follows,"We need weapons that kill, not weapons that ask why."
            <br>This issue is set to be rectified in the next prototype.
