        <strong>Subject: XK-6-19</strong>

        <!--Hebrews 6:19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
        a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil His promise is that we will receive our inheritance.
        We have this hope because he declares that we have it, and he has secured it by way of blood-->

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Project Status:</strong> Terminated
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Project Procedure:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-6-19's main body is to remain at the bottom of a 40ft x 40ft x 80ft chamber. 24,000 gallons of hydrocloric-acid is to be filled into the containment chamber and is to be replaced bi-weekly.
            <br>Excess growths must be removed by qualified personnel and is to be cauterized until a maximum of three growths remain.
            <br>XK-6-19 requires six-hundred pounds of high-protein meat every three days, although the meat can be supplemented by a mixture including.
        </p>

        <li>71% Carbon</li>
        <li>14.6% Calcium</li>
        <li>9% Phosphorus</li>
        <li>4% Potassium</li>
        <li>2% Sodium</li>
        <li>2% Chlorine</li>
        <li>1% Magnesium</li>
        <li>.4% Sulfer</li>

        <p>
            If XK-6-19 begins releasing memetic fluxuations that cross a harmonic resonance threshold of 3.4, a Quantitative-Resonance-Nullifier of Epsilon grade or higher will be deployed.
            <br>A series of controlled shocks will then be applied starting at 120 Volts and 15 Amps, with a 10% increase in dosage every 15 seconds up to 300 Million Volts and 30,000 Amps. 
            <br>If XK-6-19 does not cease memetic emmisions, then growths are to removed until XK-6-19 is unable to output said emmisions.
        </p>

        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-6-19 is a Bioengineered Memetic Cognitohazard. Its main body is a large mound of beige-white flesh with dark spots present in a 20:1 ratio on its surface area.
            <br>When XK-6-19 is seeking nurishment, it will extrude several proboscises from the main body. The ends of the proboscises take the forms of elvoid skulls possessing a bite force of up to 3,700 psi.
            <br>If XK-6-19 feels sufficiently threatened, then the main body will begin resonating at a frequency range of 15 to 0.1 Hertz. This frequency combined with a depression onto the Great Harmonics causes elvoid's within a range of three miles to forcefully disremember XK-6-19.
            <br>Testing volunteers describe the sensation as "The mind slipping into the cracks while the body fills in whats left."
            <br>XK-6-19 shows animalistic intelligence for all cognitive tests except for pattern recognition with ranking in the 99th percentile of subjects.

        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            The XK-6-19 project has been Terminated for failing to reach multiple project goals by the expected date.
            <br>
            <br>During the project update meeting, General Magnus became irate and stated this to Head Researcher Dr. Chaymond.
                <li>"I gave you two-trillion credits to fund this facility to help us get an edge in the war effort, and you spend two-fifths of it on this sack of flesh that does the same as a set of Class C amenestics and a bad case of Tinnitus!
                    If 37-10 wasn't going so well I would've had you court-martialed for embezzelment. I want that thing incinerated by next week so you can focus on a project that will actually help this planet win the war. Dismissed!"
                </li>
            <br>Dr. Chaymond has requested for the project to be <a href="password_prompt.html">resurrected</a>.
