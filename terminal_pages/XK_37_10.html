            XK-37-10 is the culmination of the greatest minds to find a way to protect our home. It is a self-replicating army of Warforged equipped with the tools to drive back The Great March.

Each Warforged stands at six feet tall and weighs over seven-hundred pounds with armor strong enough that enemy blades to shatter upon striking it.
