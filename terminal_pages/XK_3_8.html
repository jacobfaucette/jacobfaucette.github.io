        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>
            XK-3-8 is a prototype Planar-Resonance-Potentiometer (PRP). The goal of the project is to create a device that could harmonize with the base resonance of targets Planes within 3.6 PRU's of the Material Plane. By vibrating with the mirrored frequency of the target Plane, this allows for portals to harmonize easier with a 89% increase in sability.

        <strong>Project Notes:</strong>
        <p>
            Initial testing of the PRP was not without risk as a Junior Researcher was not following proper safety protocols and was killed. The researcher was <a href="bible_passages\\Revelation_3_8.html">resurrected</a> in a timely manner with the costs of elf-hours and materials being deducted from their pay and was promptly transfered off site. Remember to stay behind the dotted lines when prompted!
